 * WRML stands for "Web Resource Modeling Language" (and is pronounced "Wormle"). As a idea, WRML wants to help
 * establish a shared, uniform programmable Web platform - to unlock it's real potential. WRML wants to be ported to
 * other programming languages to help spread this uniformity.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * In WRML data structures are *modeled* and algorithms are *coded* (in {@link Service}s).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Model} is the base concept for all WRML "data structures". {@link Model} is the base interface of all Web
 * resource {@link Schema} {@link Proxy} instances. In addition to the {@link Map}-like (or JSON-like) get/set slot
 * value methods defined by the {@link Model} interface, WRML's runtime ensures that all {@link Model} instances also
 * provide a Java POJO-style API, with <i>getters</i> and <i>setters</i> for each {@link Slot} in the {@link Model}'s
 * associated {@link Schema}.
